Jump between Markdown source and the preview with full bidirectional scroll sync. Execute code blocks and inline code via Codebraid using Jupyter kernels or Codebraid\u2019s built-in execution system. Export to PDF, Microsoft Word, and other formats with Pandoc. Pandoc demo The animation below demonstrates Markdown features. All Pandoc extensions to Markdown syntax are fully supported, because the preview is generated with Pandoc itself! This includes features like math, definition lists, tables, strikethrough, subscripts, superscripts, and footnotes. Full bidirectional scroll sync is provided for all Markdown variants based on CommonMark. Code execution demo Optional code execution is provided by Codebraid . The animation below shows a code block being executed in notebook mode using a Jupyter kernel. Executing a code block is simply a matter of adding a Codebraid attribute to the code block and then running Codebraid. In this case, the code block has the Pandoc attributes {.python .cb-nb} . .python specifies the language, and .cb-nb specifies code execution using Codebraid\u2019s notebook ( nb ) mode. The YAML metadata at the beginning of the document sets jupyter: true to specify that Jupyter kernels are used for code execution instead of Codebraid\u2019s built-in execution system.

Install Pandoc. Download the latest version from GitHub , or see the Pandoc website for additional options and details for specific operating systems. Make sure that Pandoc is on your PATH. Install Codebraid Preview. Open the Extensions manager (boxes icon in menu on left), then search for \u201ccodebraid\u201d. You can also install via the Visual Studio Marketplace or Open VSX Registry , or download the .vsix file from GitHub for manual installation. Install Codebraid (optional, for code execution). Available from PyPI and conda-forge , or directly from GitHub . If you plan to use Jupyter kernels, you will also need jupyter_client and language kernels such as ipykernel . Some or all of these may already be installed if you are using a full Anaconda installation. You may need to configure VS Code to work with Codebraid by specifying a Python interpreter. Use the Python: Select Interpreter command from the Command Palette ( Ctrl+Shift+P ) to select the Python interpreter where Codebraid is installed. See the VS Code documentation for additional Python configuration details. Starting the preview Once the extension is installed, open a Markdown file ( .md extension). Click on the \u201cCodebraid Preview\u201d button in the status bar (bottom right). Or run the Open Codebraid Preview command from the Command Palette ( Ctrl+Shift+P , then type command).","title":"Installation"},{"location":"installation/#installation","text":"Install VS Code (or VSCodium ).
